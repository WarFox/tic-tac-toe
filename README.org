** CI

Continuous integration is setup using GitHub Actions. When a new
commit is pushed to any branch =lein test= and =linter= is run.

Tests is setup using =clojure.test= and linting is setup using
[[https://github.com/clj-kondo/clj-kondo/][clj-kondo]].

** Release

Automated release and CHANGELOG is setup using Google's
[[https://github.com/googleapis/release-please-action][releas-please-action]].

When branch is merged to =main=, =release-please= will create a new
release branch based on the changes included in the PR. If a release
branch already exists, then release notes and CHANGELOG is
automatically updated with the new changes.

For this to work we follow [[https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/][conventional commits]] and write good commit
messages.
